STATCOM (Statistics in the Community) is a student-run volunteer organization that provides pro-bono statistical consulting to local organizations that work for the common good. 

STATCOM was founded at Purdue, and other chapters exist throughout the U.S. 

**Note: STATCOM cannot provide consulting for other ISU departments or graduate students. Please refer to the [Statistical Consulting](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/statistical-consulting) at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/)**
