PFI is a non-profit that works with Iowa farmers. One of the things they do is organize small-scale field trials to study the effects of sustainable agricultural practices. The project requires the following tasks:

  - Automating the extraction of data from 20+ years of badly formatted records.
  - Data cleaning.
  - Database design.
  - Advice on best-practices for collecting and storing data in ways that make it easy to use for future analysis.
